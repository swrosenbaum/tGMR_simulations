# tGMR_simulations
Presented here is code for a flexible individual-based model (IBM) designed to simulate the accurracy and presicion of trans-generational genetic mark-recpature (tGMR) under varying demographic and sampling scenarios. Utilize our user-friendly workflow to customize the IBM for insisghts into the efficacy of tGMR across different systems. For further information, refer to our publication on "Reliability of trans-generational genetic mark-recapture (tGMR) for enumerating Pacific salmon".
