# tGMR_simulations
Here we present code for a flexible individual-based model (IBM) that simulates the accurracy and presicion of trans-generational genetic mark-recpature (tGMR) under varying demographic and sampling scenarios. Future tGMR users are encouraged to follow our workflow to understand how this IBM can be easily adapted to provide insisghts into the efficacy of tGMR in other systems. See our accompanying publication on the "Reliability of trans-generational genetic mark-recapture (tGMR) for enumerating Pacific salmon" for more details. Please reach out to sam.rosenbaum@umontana.edu for any questions related to this project.
