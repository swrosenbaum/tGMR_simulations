# tGMR_simulations
Presented here is code for a flexible individual-based model (IBM) designed to simulate the precision and accurracy of trans-generational genetic mark-recpature (tGMR) under varying demographic and sampling scenarios. Utilize our user-friendly workflow to customize the IBM for insights into the efficacy and potential biases associated with tGMR across different systems. For further information, refer to our publication in revision on "Reliability of trans-generational genetic mark-recapture (tGMR) for enumerating Pacific salmon".
